IDGAF - An experimental,esoteric web application framework

Concepts/Brainstorm:
- Fossil SCM built in - because it's awesome!
- BottlePY as base server/http implementation and routing via Bottle's core features
- Entirely centric on massive use of SQLite3
- Possibly integrate with SQLite Web Assembly
- Uses a table for every user, or TYPE, or Type of Type (Entities)
- Generates front end and back end code
- Fast and flexible with little assumption of use cases, but data driven
- SQL Lite tools for working with, transforming, and migrating data of various file formats and DBMS
- Simplifies all common front end development and rendering
- GUI for development, administration, operations and monitoring
- Multi-tenant features
- Write and implement IDGAF in IDGAF itself!!!

[ Development GUI local mode -> IDGAF framework/tools -> ]

[ users application (controller, services, DB) -> Browser UI or client ] ->

[ Runtime debug, monitoring, logs ]

[ user's application -> CI/DI -> test-> build -> package -> deployment ]


Idea:
binserve, optimized for heavy sqlite usage and workflows, possibly across containers and or large filesystems,
with built in bioinformatics and workflow tools and algorithms -> served with a GUI..
