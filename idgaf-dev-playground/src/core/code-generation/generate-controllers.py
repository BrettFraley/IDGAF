# Goal: Generate route, query, and template pages within the dev playground
# this then becomes part of the development experience - being able to
# generate code both for the user's target application and for the 
# Integrated Dev Gateway/Playground/Project Management Features.
# Generate scaffolds for documentations POSTS, TODOs, NEW Project Management Pages, etc...

# NOTE: functionality such as this (code generation should all remain in core). 
# The 'core' dir is for functionality that is utilized in the playground, as well
# as the main framework itself to develop applications. The core code is increasingly
# used to build the playground and framework features, while becoming part of the framework itself.

# classify different route and controller types eg:
# SQL query or command type
# render a static template
# DB SELECT returns rows as a variable passed to a template
# Generate generic DB Select template output

def generate_route_controller(path, controller_name, template_name, route_params, method, controller_functions):
    # Define the template for the route controller
    controller_template = f'''


# Route definition
generated_route = f"@app.route('{path}', methods=[{method}])
def {controller_name({', '.join(route_params)})}:
    # Your controller logic here
    \n{'    '.join(controller_functions)}

    return {controller_template}"

# Example usage
# file_path_input = "/example"
# template_name_input = "example_template"
# route_params_input = ["param1", "param2"]
# controller_functions_input = ["# Function 1 logic", "# Function 2 logic"]

# generated_code = generate_route_controller(file_path_input, template_name_input, route_params_input, method, controller_functions_input)

# print(generated_code)
