IDGAF Dev Playground is the entry point
for devloping IDGAF itself.

Dev Playground is meant to convey that this is an area of experimentation
in prototyping features and ideas for an 'Integrated Development Gateway Application Framework' -
a 'gateway' framework for a suite of tools for building applications.
