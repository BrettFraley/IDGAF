# IDGAF

### An Experimental, Esoteric Web Application Framework.

_What does IDGAF stand for?_

If you're not familiar with esoteric programming languages or..._nevermind I'm sure anyone reading this has that figured out_.

_Why?_

This is a very experimental and creative project to explore some rather unique feature and architecture ideas for a full stack framework. To answer why, for fun, and that it would be awesome for this project to prove useful enough and simple enough to actually gain some users. 

Actually, scratch that! That is not an IDGAF attitude! I'm building IDGAF because it's going to be awesome!

#### Environment For Working On IDGAF Itself

Pipenv is used for dependency management. 

Load the virtual environment: `pipenv shell`

Install dependencies: `pipenv install`

The `idgaf-dev-playground` is it's own application intended for
development od the framework itself.

Within the `idgaf-dev-playground` directory
